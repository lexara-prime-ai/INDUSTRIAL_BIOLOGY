# Industrial Biology
### Overview and Introduction

* The University of Manchester (_Manchester Institute of Biotechnology_)

**Industrial biotechnology** is the production and processing technology of industrial products by using biochemical reactions, and it is a high-level natural process for human beings to simulate biological systems to realize their own development needs.

## Enzymes - Biocatalysts
* **Enzymes** are _protein catalysts_ that _speed up_ the rate of _chemical reactions_ in _living organisms_.

They are encoded by the DNA that determines the sequence of amino acids, folded into a precise secondary and **tertiary structure**.

They may contain other molecules, referred to as **coenzymes** such as FMN, small **organic** groups (that are also involved in the reaction Chemistry catalyzed by enzyme molecules) or prosthetic groups such as _metal ions_.

* Enzymes can be categorized into different **reaction classes** depending on the precise Chemistry that they *catalyze*.
* They include: *Oxidoreductases, Transferases, Hydrolases, Lyases, Isomerases*.

## How are Enzymes made
* **Biosynthesis** i.e. produced naturally by *living organisms* by **transcription** and **translation**.
**Transcription** - refers to the production of an **RNA** copy of the **DNA code** for a specific protein by *RNA polymerase*.

**Translation** - refers to the process whereby a **ribosome** reads the **transcript** and links together the *amino acids* in the correct sequence for each specific protein.

### Summary
> Proteins are made by other proteins, following a DNA/RNA code.
> The genetic code is universal.
> A gene from one organism can be transcribed/translated into another.

## Nature's Catalysts
*"No enzymes, no life"* most biochemical reactions would NOT occur under the mild conditions within cells.

* Rate enhancements catalyzed by enzymes are typically 10<sup>15</sup>-10<sup>23</sup>.

**NOTE**: In the absence of an enzyme, some reactions would take longer than the age of the universe.

* Some enzymes require **cofactors** or **coenzymes** (e.g. *heme, flavin*) or prosthetic groups (e.g. metal ions).
